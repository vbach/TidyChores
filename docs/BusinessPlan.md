## Tidy Chores will make money by...

Tidy Chores will take advantage of multiple avenues of revenue, ad support and freemium services. With well placed and targeted ads users will not only benefit from the revenue stream but Tidy Chores will be able to self sustain. For those users who wish to not have ads, they will have the option to pay an annual subscription fee of $9.99 to use the app without any ads or distractions with unlimited household members and no restrictions on the number of chores. 

There will also be a freemium options where users can continue to use the application for free but if they wish to add more than 4 household members, they can pay $1.00 per member. Further they can also choose to purchase the option to add more than the limited 3 chores to each child, per day at a cost of $3.00 per 8 additional chores.

## My competitors
Cozi Family Manager uses a subscription model to support their application. According to reviews, many members oppose being blocked from many features unless they subscribe however claim to continue to use the app despite the indifference.

Class Dojo Beyond School is completely blocked behind a subscription model with the exception of a free trial. 

Allowance and Chores Bot has a one time $2.99 fee. Based off reviews it seems the user base is satisfied with this one time fee.

OurHome is completely free with no hidden costs or ad support. According to [startupdaily.net](https://www.startupdaily.net/2014/12/melbourne-startup-ourhome-gamifies-household-chores-children/) OurHome intends to monetize eventually using typical streams of revenue. There is mention of OurHome seeking investors (seed capital) however it is unclear if the app is investor supported at this time or not. Obviously, users are very satisfied with the current model.

S’mores Up is another app that I entirely free. It is unclear how S’mores Up is financially maintained but I believe it is safe to say that they are supported by seed capital. Again, this is a revenue model that users have no complaints about.

## Projected income

### Freemium Revenue
According to SweetPricing.com’s article about [Freemium Mobile Apps](https://sweetpricing.com/blog/2017/01/freemium-mobile-apps/), 0.5-2% of users are willing to take advantage of in-app purchases or subscriptions. The idea is to enhance the experience, not inhibit free users. With this in mind, Tidy Chores will take advantage of the following freemium features:

Free users are limited to: 4 household members per account, 3 chores per household member.

Tidy Chores freemium options will offer:
 * $1 per additional household member
 * $3 for 8 additional chores used at user discretion (i.e: one child can get 4 additional chores or these 8 chores can be spread amongst all household members.)
 * $9.99 annual fee for ad free use, unlimited chores and household members. Subscription members will also have access to any freemium offers that may come with new features.

With an assumption of 3 million users, a value determined by the median of users of our competitors and assuming 1.25% (37,500 freemium users) purchase freemium services this revenue would essentially accrue annually: $93,712.50

### Ad Revenue - CPC & CPM
For my competitors that have a website, through the use of (siterankdata.com)[siterankdata.com] I was able to search my competitors to see what their estimated monthly visitors are. These are the results:

 * Cozi Family Organizer - 4,156,924 monthly visitors
 * Class Dojo - 9,184,024 monthly visitors
 * Our Home - 202,603 monthly visitors
 * S’mores App - 294,290 monthly visitors

CPM (revenue earned per 1000 views)
3mil/1000 * 1.20 = 3600 per month for CPM

### Overall
With the assumption of 3 million users in the first year, Tidy Chores projected first year revenue: $136,912.50
