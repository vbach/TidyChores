## Tidy Chores will make money by...

Tidy Chores will ad-supported and take advantage of affiliate marketing through services such as amazon. With well placed and targeted ads, and thoughtful suggestions for products geared toward the target market, users will not only benefit from the revenue stream but Tidy Chores will be able to self sustain. For those users who wish to not have ads, they will have the option to pay an annual subscription fee of $10 to use the app without any ads or distractions with unlimited household members and no restrictions on the number of chores. 

There will also be a freemium options where users can continue to use the application for free but if they wish to add more than 4 household members, they can pay $1.00 per member. Further they can also choose to purchase the option to add more than the limited 3 chores to each child, per day at a cost of $1.00 per 3 additional chores.

## My competitors
Cozi Family Manager - Cozi Family Manager uses a subscription model to support their application. According to reviews, many members oppose being blocked from many features unless they subscribe however claim to continue to use the app despite the indifference.

Class Dojo - Class Dojo Beyond School is completely blocked behind a subscription model with the exception of a free trial. 

Allowance and Chores Bot has a one time $2.99 fee. Based off reviews it seems the user base is satisfied with this one time fee.

OurHome is completely free with no hidden costs or ad support. According to [startupdaily.net](https://www.startupdaily.net/2014/12/melbourne-startup-ourhome-gamifies-household-chores-children/) OurHome intends to monetize eventually using typical streams of revenue. There is mention of OurHome seeking investors (seed capital) however it is unclear if the app is investor supported at this time or not. Obviously, users are very satisfied with the current model.

S’mores Up is another app that I entirely free. It is unclear how S’mores Up is financially maintained but I believe it is safe to say that they are supported by seed capital. Again, this is a revenue model that users have no complaints about.

## Projected income
*Given your projected target audience (from week 1), how much are you likely to make? Think about their income level and how much they would be willing to spend. Also think about how broad the audience is if your project only reaches a smaller set of the population, you are less likely as many users a project that has broad appeal, which impacts the projected income.*

*Is your projected income enough to make it worth developing the project? Is there some other reason to build the app outside of revenue? If the answer is no to both those questions, reach out to your instructor because it might be better to make something else that will keep you engaged.*

###Freemium revenue
According to SweetPricing.com’s article about (Freemium Mobile Apps)[https://sweetpricing.com/blog/2017/01/freemium-mobile-apps/], 0.5-2% of users are willing to take advantage of in-app purchases or subscriptions. The idea is to enhance the experience, not inhibit free users. With this in mind, Tidy Chores will take advantage of the following freemium features:

Free users are limited to: 4 household members per account, 3 chores per household member.

Tidy Chores freemium options will offer:
 * $1 per additional household member
 * $3 for 4 additional chores used at user discretion (i.e: one child can get 4 additional chores or these 4 chores can be spread amongst all household members.)
 * $9.99 lifetime fee for ad free use, up to 6 household members, and up to 5 chores per household member.

With an assumption of 3 million users, a value determined by the median of users of our competitors, this revenue would essentially accrue annually: 
.5% of users - $37,485 annual
2% of users = $149,940 annual

### Ad Revenue - CPC & CPM

For my competitors that have a website, through the use of (siterankdata.com)[siterankdata.com] I was able to search my competitors to see what their estimated monthly visitors are. These are the results:

 * Cozi Family Organizer - 4,156,924 monthly visitors
 * Class Dojo - 9,184,024 monthly visitors
 * Our Home - 202,603 monthly visitors
 * S’mores App - 294,290 monthly visitors

Using both CPM (revenue earned per 1000 views) and CPC (revenue earned per click)
 3mil/1000 * 1.20 = 3600 per month for CPM
