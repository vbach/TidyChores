# Revenue



## [Project Name] will make money by...

*If you plan to make it free, explain why this is a sensible decision. Note that ad-supported or freemium apps are not free. If you are going to make your app a paid service, explain how much and in what way (subscriptions, one-time costs, etc.) this fee will be collected.*

## My competitors
*Explain what your competition is doing to support their development and promotion. What do users think of this cost?*

## Projected income
*Given your projected target audience (from week 1), how much are you likely to make? Think about their income level and how much they would be willing to spend. Also think about how broad the audience is if your project only reaches a smaller set of the population, you are less likely as many users a project that has broad appeal, which impacts the projected income.*

*Is your projected income enough to make it worth developing the project? Is there some other reason to build the app outside of revenue? If the answer is no to both those questions, reach out to your instructor because it might be better to make something else that will keep you engaged.*

# Marketing

## Elevator Pitch

*An elevator pitch is a couple of short sentences that illustrate your problem, solution, and unique value. Think of being stuck in an elevator with someone in your target audience, and you only have till the ground floor to show them the value of your product. What would you say? What would you say to your aunt when she asks you about your project?*

## Keywords

*We will be talking more about marketing later in your Capstone Project, but it is essential that you are beginning to think about keywords now so that you can be using them in any content you write. Keywords should be both single words and groups of words that you can use to attract your target audience to your site.*

# Change Orders

*Create a markdown template here that you can use to make change orders to your project. Now that you have created your project plan when you wish to alter it, you will use this template to request a change to the plan.*
