# Tech Stack
Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.


## Adobe XD
You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**
I feel extremely comfortable with Adobe XD and using UI kits to create the visual design of my application. 

**What are your concerns around using XD?**
I don’t have any concerns with using Adobe XD.

## React
You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**
I feel moderately comfortable using React.

**What are your concerns around using React?**
We have touched on React a few times throughout the degree but I don’t feel 100% competent with it yet. I am mainly concerned about getting stuck with state and passing props (and proptypes). To help with this, I’ve found a short course that I am going to start as a refresher and to give myself some better footing.

## Redux
Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.

**How comfortable do you feel with Redux?**
I don’t feel comfortable at all.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**
Redux I just began to learn last week, so my knowledge and experience with redux is very slim. Along with the react course I found, it also covers Redux so I am aiming to be a lot more comfortable with Redux when it is time to begin the development work for my application.

## Node
You will be using Node as your server for both your API and to render your front-end. You will be required to use best practices, npm, and npx.

**How comfortable do you feel with Node?**
Fairly comfortable.

**What are your concerns around using Node?**
I feel fairly good about using node although I am hesitant to use any packages that I have not used and haven’t been covered through our courses. 

## Express
You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**
Fairly comfortable.

**What are your concerns around using Express?**
I feel pretty good about Express. I struggled a bit with Express in ASL, so I spent a great deal of time trying to understand and be able to use/implement Express correctly - I hope that I can successfully bring what I learned to this project.

## SQL/Posgres/Sequelize
You will be utilizing a relational database with Sequelize as an ORM. You will be creating migrations, models, and seeds as well utilizing the models with full validated CRUD.

**How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize?**
Fairly comfortable.

**What are your concerns around using Sequelize?**
Using this combination in ASL, I’d say I feel pretty good about using it for my final project. I had to go a bit further in ASL and add details to my database, which gave me a bit more experience and exploration on Sequelize then I think I otherwise would have. So I am not really concerned using Sequelize, outside of making sure I structure my databases correctly.
