## User Profile

Monica is a 38 year old stay at home mom of 3 kids between the ages of 8 and 14 years old. She’s tried multiple solutions to keeping organized with chores and her kids activities from white boards, calendars, lists and notebooks. Often she gets frustrated with trying to find their schedule, what chores need to be done, etc. She desperately wants a centralized location, preferably an app, that keeps it simple and easy to access at any time. 

Jessica is 33 years old, works full time, and has 2 children who are 10 and 12. She currently uses a handwritten chart for chores and likes that her kids are able to see what is expected of them every day. However, she dislikes that it is handwritten and becomes a mess as she makes changes and alterations. She doesn’t like to have to rewrite the chart whenever a change is needed. Jessica would prefer to have an application that can be accessed by all members of her family reducing confusion, increasing convenience and improving the ease of making changes. 

Luke is a single Dad who is 28 years old. He has one child who is 7 years old and has begun to take on some of the household responsibilities. He doesn’t have a chore chart or an organization system and has at times found it overwhelming to decide on what chores his child should do that day. He’d like a simple day by day solution that helps him track chores for each day of the week that rewards his child for completing them.

## Use Cases

It’s that time of day, kids are home and they are in the midst of their chores. Her youngest child has completed her chores for the day and has asked if she can check them off. Jessica gives her daughter access to their laptop where her daughter loads Tidy Chores. The app is already logged in and her daughter selects her name. She is given a view with a list of her chores for the day and she checks off each one that has been completed. She is given a notice that she has earned 25 points for all of the chores she has finished today and has a total of 56 points overall.

Monica opens Tidy Chores to set up this week's chores. She’s presented with an overview of the weeks activities and each child's name. Selecting her oldest child she sees a list of his chores for the day. She wants to add an additional chore of cleaning his bedroom, she clicks add and is presented with a modal form to add the name of the chore, the point value, deadline for completion and an option to make this a recurring chore for this day every week. After filling out the form, she clicks submit and it appears on his list of chores for the day.

It’s the end of the week and Luke is ready to tally up the points his child has earned during the week. Luke logins into the Tidy Chores and sees that his child has earned 30 points, his child can choose to cash them out now for an award or continue to build them for a greater award. While checking his childs point total, he realizes he hasn’t set up any rewards yet. Clicking on the award pane he sees suggestions for $5, trip to the zoo, movie tickets, no-chore day, candy bar, ice cream, and more. He selects a few of these choices and is then given the option to change the reward point cost. Satisfied with the predetermined point values he confirms and is now ready to let his child choose whether to cash out or continue earning.

## Problem Statement

Keeping track of day to day chores and obligations is a major stress point for most parents. Often this requires multiple different tools from whiteboards, calendars, notebooks etc. and requires the parent to also keep track of all of these tools. To reduce the clutter, frustration and managing all of these tools parents are seeking an app that can help them keep track, change, update, and modify their daily chore schedules that is accessible to all family members.

## Pain Points
Based off a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16-ldvC1idNYs4N_hL-CJ1P0CDscpDkX3R4A4YhJVXNw/) I asked of parents that I knew and that they shared with their friends and groups these are the top pain points parents have:

1. Sometimes the things that need to get done are not listed for that day or are things we have already done recently.
2. It’s not automated, it requires me keeping up with each chore.
3. Lacks incentive.
4. That it is handwritten. I wish it was something that was electronic and could be used by multiple people at once.

## Solution Statement

Tidy Chores will solve the pain points outlined above by being an all in one source for family chore management. Integrated with an optional reward system to give children incentive where they can cash out points earned for an award, these awards are created by the parent with in-app suggestions for ideas. Every member of the family is able to access the account and see their chores for the day, as well as mark them off as they are completed.
