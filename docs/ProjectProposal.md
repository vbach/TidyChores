# Tidy Chores

## Application Definition Statement

Tidy Chores aims to solve the daily problems of family schedules and chore lists for children in the home. One of the biggest pain points as a parent is the repeat questions and confusion as to what is expected of each child each day - this problem only grows with the number of children in the home. Tidy Chores prevents the paper clutter, multiple apps, and the frustration over expectations that parents encounter on a daily basis by being a centralized, easy to use application accessible on the web and mobile. 

## Target Market

Target market is working and stay at home Mothers ages 25 to 45 with children between the ages of 5 and 18 who assign chores on a daily basis.

A secondary market would be Fathers, ages 25 to 45, with children between the ages of 5 and 18, that maintain the flow of their homes.

## User Profile

Monica is a 31 year old stay at home mom of 3 kids between the ages of 8 and 14 years old. She’s tried multiple solutions to keeping organized with chores and her kids activities from white boards, calendars, lists and notebooks. Often she gets frustrated with trying to find their schedule, what chores need to be done, etc. She desperately wants a centralized location, preferably an app, that keeps it simple and easy to access at any time. 

Jessica is 33 years old, works full time, and has 2 children who are 10 and 12. She currently uses a handwritten chart for chores and likes that her kids are able to see what is expected of them every day. However, she dislikes that it is handwritten and becomes a mess as she makes changes and alterations. She doesn’t like to have to rewrite the chart whenever a change is needed. Jessica would prefer to have an application that can be accessed by all members of her family reducing confusion, convenience and improving the ease of making changes. 

Luke is a single Dad who is 28 years old. He has one child who is 7 years old and has begun to take on some of the household responsibilities. He doesn’t have a chore chart or an organization system and has at times found it overwhelming to decide on what chores his child should do that day. He’d like a simple day by day solution that helps him track chores for each day of the week that rewards his child for completing them.

## Use Cases

It is Wednesday and it has been a busy day for Jessica. Her children are on their way home from school and she needs to be ready with their list of chores and obligations when they get home. She knows that her kids are able to open the app and see what their chores are for the day. When they get home, they open up their app and login to their respective accounts. After logging in they are greeted with a list of chores, points that can be earned for completing them and the option to check them off as they are completed.

Monica opens Tidy Chores to reorganize the weeks chores due to activities taking up the time typically spent at home. Realizing that it is unrealistic to expect her children to complete these chores and participate in all of the activities planned for the evening, Monica selects each chore and moves them to different days during the week that are not as busy.

It’s the end of the week and Luke is ready to tally up the points his child has earned during the week. Luke logins into the Parent Command Center and sees that his child has earned 30 points, his child can choose to cash them out now for an award or continue to build them for a greater award.

## Problem Statement

Keeping track of day to day chores and obligations is a major stress point for most parents. Often this requires multiple different tools from whiteboards, calendars, notebooks etc. and requires the parent to also keep track of all of these tools. To reduce the clutter, frustration and multiple locations of running a smooth household on a day to day basis, parents are seeking an app that can help them keep track, change, update, and modify their daily chore schedules that is accessible to all family members.

## Pain Points
Based off a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16-ldvC1idNYs4N_hL-CJ1P0CDscpDkX3R4A4YhJVXNw/) I asked of parents that I knew and that they shared with their friends and groups these are the top pain points parents have:

1. Sometimes the things that need to get done are not listed for that day or are things we have already done recently.
2. It’s not automated, it requires me keeping up with each chore.
3. Lacks incentive.
4. That it is handwritten. I wish it was something that was electronic and could be used by multiple people at once.

## Solution Statement

Tidy Chores will solve the pain points outlined above by being an all in one source for family chore management. Integrated with an optional reward system to give children incentive where they can cash out points earned for an award, these awards are created by the parent with in-app suggestions for ideas. Every member of the family is able to access the account and see their chores for the day, as well as mark them off as they are completed.
