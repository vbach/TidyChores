# [Concept Name]

## Application Definition Statement

*A* *clear* *high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to* *"What* *are you building**?”.* *You will e**xplore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.* 

*Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement.*

## Target Market

*Using research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

*Are there any secondary markets have many but not all overlapping defining characteristics that should be identified and design considerations be accommodated?*

## User Profile

*User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market.*

## Use Cases

*Defining a typical use case or scenario that a user would be interacting with your application provides a fixed path of interaction that you can refine your user’s experience around. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout does requiring them to clicking 10+ times make sense while they are impatiently trying to start their exercise regimen? Use cases help to think through how your application will commonly be used.*

*Use Cases will help to drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. Regularly testing as if you were a user following a use case throughout the project development lifecycle will provide valuable insight into how your application is addressing the needs of the user and allow you to correct missteps early.*

## Problem Statement

*In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.*

## Pain Points

*Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.*

## Solution Statement

*How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?*

## Competition

*What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own.*

## Key Features

*Define key features intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key features should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points. More generic features like User Authentication should not be defined here.*

## Integrations

*Identify what 3rd party APIs, data sets, or external integrations are planned for use and outline how you will use them transformatively. Provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service.*
