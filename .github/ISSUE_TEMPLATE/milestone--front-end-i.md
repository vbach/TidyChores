During this milestone I will be working on creating a click-through of my application in React, using default props to populate the pages.

###  Routes:
1. / -> Homepage
2. /login -> Login with username/password
3. /signup -> Sign Up with username/password
4. /parent/:id -> Parent view, list of of all children
5. /parent/child/new -> Add new child
6. /parent/child/edit/:id -> Edit child
7. /parent/child/:id -> View child (with chore list)
8. /parent/chores -> View all chores
9. /parent/chores/new -> Add new chore
10. /parent/chores/edit/:id -> Edit chore
11. /parent/rewards -> View all rewards
12. /parent/rewards/new -> Add new reward
13. /parent/rewards/edit/:id -> Edit reward
14. /parent/child/rewards/:id -> Cashout points for reward


### Things I might struggle with...
I am familiar with React but not comfortable so I am taking a quick course on udemy to brush up on React. I started this in week one so that I will be more confident in my skills by the time I approach this milestone.

Figuring out the correct route and method to cash out a childs chore points for a reward I believe will be the biggest struggle.
