During this milestone I will be working on adding my reducers and actions to get the flow of data.

###  Reducers:
1. Auth
2. Parent
3. Child
4. Chores
5. Rewards

### Things I might struggle with...
Out of all the tools being used for this project, Redux is what I have the least experience with. In combination with React, I made sure the course I am taking through udemy also covers Redux. I intend to complete that course and possibly do a mini project tutorial using Redux before approaching this stage in development.
